# Abstract
This project is an open-source C++ library enabling developers to transform audio effortlessly without DSP expertise. The current stage of development is building out the audio effects and tweaking them to be high quality. 

# Key Features and Technologies used
This project is written in C++. Currently the basic flow of the program is processing a sound file and applying some audio processing technique to it. time stretching pitch shifting reverb and autotune have a working implementation.  

<!-- # How to Use
To use this application, put any voice samples in the samples folder. In src/main.cpp, apply audio processing to a given .mp3 or .wav file

First install [libsndfile](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile)
Clone this [FFT Repo](https://github.com/mborgerding/kissfft)

navigate to the build directory 

run `cd build` \
run `cmake ..` \
run `make` 

excecute the `mc` excetuable providing a sound file. Here is provided with an example sound file \
`./mc Diner.wav`

A file titled out.wav will be written to the build directory -->
